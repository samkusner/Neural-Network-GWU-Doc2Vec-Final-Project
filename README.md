# Neural-Network-GWU-Doc2Vec-Final-Project
## Team: Adham Popal, Jacob Roedel, Samantha Kusner
Project: Our team would like to work on the doc2vec network in tensorflow. This was the most interesting choice for each of our team members, and we are excited to see what we can do!<br>
Research we have done: <br>
At least 2-3 websites/git repos/journal articles/etc. with 1-2 sentences detailing the value or application of the research.<br>

This github repository details how prior models and methodologies are scaled up to make the Doc2Vec model. It is important that we understand the foundation behind Doc2Vec and it gives great preliminary visualization that will be useful for our initial understanding.<br><br>

The value of finding this article was to get a better understanding of doc2vec and each of its components: Distributed Memory (DM) and Distributed Bag of Words (DBOW). As stated before, itâ€™s important to get a full grasp on the background of the model so that we are able to create a well-done implementation.<br>

For our presentation, we want to talk about surrounding applications and research of the model. Additionally, it provides extremely high level code that can give us an idea of how to design our network in Tensorflow.
